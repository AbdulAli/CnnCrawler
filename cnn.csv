Trump signals alarm with Democrats poised to escalate impeachment offensive,Nov 3  2019,Democrats are primed to pivot to a critical new phase of impeachment -- building a public case that President Donald Trump abused his power -- to ensure no shows by administration witnesses don't blunt their momentum. At that point  the process would shift from a closed doors investigation of Trump's covert Ukraine policy into an attempt to convince Americans that he should be removed from office in dramatic televised hearings. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is also expected to start releasing transcripts of witness testimony delivered in closed door depositions as early as this week. The plan prompted Trump to launch what was  even by his own standards  an extraordinary torrent of personal abuse at the California Democrat. "House Republicans must have nothing to do with Shifty's rendition of those interviews. He is a proven liar  leaker & freak who is really the one who should be impeached!" Trump tweeted. At least six executive branch insiders have made it known over the past few days they will ignore subpoenas to testify  but this week could still hold a sting in the tail. Former national security adviser John Bolton  a fiery figure who was recently fired by Trump  is due to testify on Thursday -- though there are doubts over whether he will appear. A Bolton sighting would spark a frenzy since other witnesses have testified that he decried Trump's decision to outsource Ukraine policy -- a caper one former senior official said he referred to as a "drug deal." No one could be sure what Bolton might say. Would he stay loyal to his former boss or to the iconoclastic approach to foreign policy that steered him through a colorful career in Washington? "I like John Bolton. I always got along with him " Trump said Sunday  misrepresenting his relationship with the renowned Washington bruiser in a possible sign of concern about his potential testimony. Asked whether Bolton speak up  Trump replied: " ... that's going to be up to him." Democrats believe they have built a strong case that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate a domestic rival -- Democratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden -- during weeks of depositions featuring career officials. But if executive branch officials due to testify this week do not show up  they may reach a point when there is little to be gained by holding off a more visible phase of the inquiry. Party leaders believe they already have a strong enough case to go ahead without holdout witnesses  though more evidence could further bolster their confidence. Long list of potential witnesses All four White House officials who are scheduled to give depositions on Monday during the House's impeachment inquiry won't show up  as a source with knowledge of the situation tells CNN that National Security Council lawyers John Eisenberg and Michael Ellis will not testify. The two officials will join Robert Blair  assistant to the President and senior adviser to the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney  and Brian McCormack  associate director for natural resources  energy & science at the Office of Management and Budget  in not testifying on Monday  CNN reported earlier. Energy Secretary Rick Perry  who was scheduled to appear Wednesday  will not participate in a closed door deposition  an Energy Department spokesperson said Friday. Bolton's lawyer has said he will not appear without a subpoena. But it's not clear if he will testify even if he is served. And since Democrats have said they will not allow the impeachment drive to be bogged down in legal challenges like the one that could be necessary to force Bolton's compliance  they may move ahead without him. Democrats have also warned that they will consider Trump administration attempts to block testimony by officials as a sign of obstruction that could be folded into articles of impeachment. If they are stymied in the committee room  Democrats could begin releasing transcripts of previous depositions this week that are expected to paint a damning picture of Trump's conduct. When the full House returns after a week-long break next Monday  two weeks will remain before the Thanksgiving recess -- a potential window for public hearings. In the normal course of events  the schedule for next week's committee business would be announced by the middle of this week. Democrats hope to bring back important witnesses -- for example the top US diplomat in Kiev  Bill Taylor  who they believe will help them build a devastating picture of presidential malfeasance and unconstitutional behavior. House Foreign Affairs committee chairman Eliot Engel laid out the theory of the case -- and a challenge to Republicans who want to shield Trump  in a television appearance on Sunday. "No other president in American history has done something like that " Engel said on ABC News "This Week." "He tried to essentially bribe a foreign power to interfere in US elections on his side to go after one of his political opponents " Engel argued. New whistleblower gambit In a new development over the weekend  lawyers for the intelligence community whistleblower who first raised alarm about Trump's dealings with Ukraine said their client was willing to answer written questions directly from Republicans without going through the Democratic majority. The unidentified official's legal team has warned about threats to his safety. And Democrats now say their case is so strong that the whistleblower may not be needed to testify in public. But Steve Scalise  the number two ranked House Republican  called for the whistleblower to testify to the committees investigating impeachment  complaining that "somebody behind closed doors  in secret" was "trying to take out a sitting president." Rep. Jim Jordan  the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee  says written answers from the anonymous whistleblower are not sufficient  and said lawmakers need to hear from the whistleblower in person. "Written answers will not provide a sufficient opportunity to probe all the relevant facts and cross examine the so-called Whistleblower. You don't get to ignite an impeachment effort and never account for your actions and role in orchestrating it. We have serious questions about this individual's political bias and partisan motivations and it seems Mark Zaid and Adam Schiff are attempting to hide these facts from public scrutiny. Last week's testimony raised even more concerns about the anonymous whistleblower and our need to hear from them  in person " Jordan said in a statement. The Republican struggle to counter the facts of the case leaking out of the hearings was reflected in the scattershot defenses made by Trump loyalists on Sunday talk shows. On CNN's "State of the Union " White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said she didn't know whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine -- the key matter at issue in the case. But she stood by the White House response that there was no quid pro quo between Trump and the former Soviet state. "President Trump never said to the Ukrainian President 'do this and you'll get your aid.' It is simply not here " she said  referring to a rough transcript of a July 25 call between Trump and the President of Ukraine. "Quid pro quo  yes or no?" CNN's Dana Bash asked Conway. "I just said to you. I don't know whether aid was being held up and for how long " Conway replied. 'Not impeachable' Republican lawmakers tried out various lines of defense for the President  who has reportedly been frustrated that he is not being defended on the merits of the case. "Look  if I believed everything the Democrats are saying I would still say this isn't an impeachable offense " said Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole on NBC's "Meet the Press." Cole is a nine-term veteran who once ran the House GOP's campaign arm and was a campaign consultant earlier in his career. "Now we're going to do this on a phone call? I mean  I just don't think this rises to the level " he said. The case that Democrats are building relates to far more than the phone call between the two Presidents. Leaks from depositions suggest that senior officials believe there was a long-running scheme to coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden and a conservative conspiracy theory that Kiev and not Russia interfered in the 2016 election. But arguing that Trump's conduct does not meet the high crimes and misdemeanors standard for impeachment could be a viable path for Republicans caught between conservative grass roots support for the President and personal disquiet about his behavior. Such an approach is not sitting well with Trump however  whose life code precludes any admission of wrongdoing and argued Sunday that the July call was "perfecto" and "totally appropriate." "False stories are being reported that a few Republican Senators are saying that President Trump may have done a quid pro quo  but it doesn't matter  there is nothing wrong with that  it is not an impeachable event. Perhaps so  but read the transcript  there is no quid pro quo!" Trump tweeted on Sunday.
All four White House officials scheduled for House inquiry depositions Monday won't testify,Nov 3  2019,All four White House officials who are scheduled to give depositions on Monday during the House's impeachment inquiry won't show up  as a source with knowledge of the situation tells CNN that National Security Council lawyers John Eisenberg and Michael Ellis will not testify. The two officials will join Robert Blair  assistant to the President and senior adviser to the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney  and Brian McCormack  associate director for natural resources  energy & science at the Office of Management and Budget  in not testifying on Monday  CNN reported earlier. Energy Secretary Rick Perry  who was scheduled to appear Wednesday  will not participate in a closed door deposition  an Energy Department spokesperson said Friday. An administration official says Eisenberg isn't showing up due to executive privilege while Blair  Ellis and McCormack aren't going to appear because they won't be able to have an administration lawyer present. Blair's attorney  Whit Ellerman  told CNN Saturday that "Blair is caught between the assertions of legal duty by two coequal branches of government  a conflict which he cannot resolve." Two other OMB officials  Michael Duffey and Russell Vought  also won't show up to their depositions later this week  a source with knowledge of the situation tells CNN. As more witnesses in the impeachment probe continue to refuse to give testimony  House investigators are signaling they are prepared to begin the next phase of their inquiry -- even if their subpoenas are ignored across the board. A number of House Democrats told CNN that it's time for that next step  saying they've already built enough evidence to advance the proceedings to the public stage. "This isn't an Agatha Christie novel -- this is a shakedown " said Rep. Jamie Raskin  a Democrat from Maryland who has taken part in the closed door depositions. "I think we have established an overwhelming case. But we have got very careful prosecutors on the staff who rightfully want to leave no witness unexamined  and they want every detail to be nailed down as much as possible. That's good." Raskin added: "But at a certain point we have to say ... there's just been an overwhelming case that high crimes and misdemeanors have likely been committed against our country." The inquiry is rooted in a whistleblower complaint that deals with a phone call President Donald Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. A transcript of the conversation released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son  Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

From Washington's fight to the front lines in Ukraine,Nov 3  2019,On the front lines of Ukraine's war with Russia  the conditions are basic and the enemy is close. At a Ukrainian position in the southeast of the country  the troops fight from dirt trenches that twist and turn through the flat terrain. One soldier with a thick mustache stands at a lookout  his machine gun nestled in his shoulder. Just six hundred yards away  the sandbags of the Russian-backed separatists can be seen. "They use drones to drop mines on our positions " the commander  Pavel Sergeevich  tells CNN  nodding in the direction of the enemy. He says one of his men was shot dead by a sniper 10 days ago. There's supposed to be a ceasefire  but it is broken regularly. After five years and about 13 000 deaths  many in the outside world had forgotten the conflict in Ukraine until America's political crisis catapulted it into the headlines again. In July  when President Donald Trump was encouraging new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival  former Vice President Joe Biden  nearly $400 million in military and security aid to Ukraine had already been suspended and would continue to be for months. Whether the aid was held up to pressure the opening of a corruption inquiry and whether that is impeachable is now a key part of the action House Democrats are launching against the President. By the time Sergeevich and his men learned about the freeze  that aid had already been released. But the delay left a chill. Sergeevich told CNN he was "unhappy and disappointed. America is our strongest and most important ally." How the US is involved It's hard to find much evidence of American military aid on the front lines beyond US-issued tourniquets and bandages and night vision goggles. This battlefield near Shyrokyne  with its trenches hand-dug with shovels  seems to have more in common with stories of World War I than 21st century conflicts. The key weapon the United States has agreed to sell is the Javelin  an anti-tank missile  that was mentioned by Zelensky in his July 25 call with Trump. The United States has decreed that the system may not be used on the front lines  where it might lead to an escalation of force on the Russian side. But dozens of conversations with Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have revealed how the people feel themselves locked in a David and Goliath fight with Russia. Having the backing of the United States is seen as critical to leveling the playing field a little as Ukraine tries to win back parts of the country now run by Russian-backed separatists. At the other end of Ukraine  about as far away from Sergeevich's trenches as you can get  there are clearer signs of US support. Military mentors from the United States join instructors from Canada  the United Kingdom and several other NATO allies to train Ukrainian forces at the Yavoriv Combat Training Center. On the day of CNN's visit  Ukrainian soldiers practiced a mounted assault under the watchful eye of US Army Capt. Matthew Chapman. "I feel very proud of the work we've done  the work we've put into our training exercises " Chapman says. "We can see the Ukrainian soldiers  we can see them improve and we can see them become closer as a team and a lethal fighting force." When asked about his reaction to the temporary freezing of US aid  Chapman said  "personally  I don't pay attention to US ... foreign policy or politics while I'm here. We are solely focused on the mission at hand ... It has not even come up in conversation." His Ukrainian counterpart  Lt. Nazar Shpak  agrees. Asked whether the United States is a reliable ally  he nods emphatically "completely  yes  completely." Concern about Putin  and about Trump Back in the east  the real impact of this conflict is still unfolding. Nearly 1.5 million people have been displaced as town after town has been smashed by heavy bombardment. In the mining town of Toretsk  half of the population has left and most of the coal mines are shut. In the central square  the burned-out town hall stands empty  a grim reminder of the bitter battle between separatists who captured the town and the Ukrainian army who forced them out again. The nearest front line is now more than five miles away  but Leonid Makarov says the fighting is far from over. The 26-year-old history teacher lost one of his students last year. Daria Kazemirova was killed just days after her 15th birthday when an artillery shell fired by Russian-backed separatists landed in her grandmother's garden  he says. Makarov still struggles to make sense of it and of President Trump's seemingly mercurial attitude towards Ukraine and Russia. "When I hear President Trump say Vladimir Putin is a nice guy -- it's just weird. It concerns me. Putin killed my student." At a nearby center for elderly people  Yelena Salaeva says she no longer cares who wins the war. The pensioner was forced to leave her home five years ago after being wounded by shrapnel while picking tomatoes in her garden. She has not been able to go back. "We just want there to be no more war and for everyone to have their own peaceful life." Fears for the future Last month  Zelensky announced his support for a phased peace plan  in which the occupied areas of eastern Ukraine would get special self-governing status after holding local elections. But it is a long road ahead and the political crisis in the United States could yet impact Ukraine again. There is a lingering fear that bipartisan support for Ukraine could be poisoned by increasing polarization brought by the impeachment process. And if legislators will no longer stand and speak up together  that could strengthen Russia's hand. Back in his trench  Pavel Sergeevich shrugs and says his men will keep fighting  with or without US support. "We will fight even if the whole world is against us. This is our land. What choice do we have?"
How often does Trump misspell words on Twitter? These researchers have an answer,Nov 3  2019,"Shoebiz " "hamberders " "leightweight." "Rupublicans." "Infair." President Donald Trump has a serious problem with spelling  as many news outlets and late-night hosts have pointed out. He has even misspelled his wife's name on Twitter. He recently mistyped his Defense Secretary's name  too. But some of his typos have been deleted and corrected. Others have been forgotten — "covfefe" being a funny exception. There doesn't seem to be a comprehensive list. So CNN's "Reliable Sources" asked the Factba.se website  which tracks every word uttered by Trump and other politicians  to come up with a count. "Everybody makes spelling mistakes " CNN's Brian Stelter commented on Sunday's "Reliable Sources." But on Twitter  he said  "Trump makes a lot more of them than most people." Referring to Trump's typo-ridden tendencies  Stelter said  "it's not the biggest thing in the world  but it still matters. Accuracy always matters." Researchers at Factba.se went a step further and looked for misspellings by other members of Trump's family and the 2020 presidential candidates who want Trump's job. Two things make Trump's errors stand out: The quantity and the absurdity. The researchers gave Trump the benefit of every doubt and skipped things like punctuation errors. Still  they counted 188 misspellings since @realDonaldTrump took office. That's a misspelling about every five days. And they've been happening more often lately. The misspeller-in-chief should "turn on autocorrect " said Bill Frischling  the CEO of FactSquared  who led the project. His company is set to debut a new tool that will track Trump's misspellings in real time. These typos and other errors "are things that could have been avoided " Frischling pointed out. "Since he's the 11th largest Twitter account in the world  somebody should be checking it." Trump's most frequently misspelled terms include "councel " "Barrack Obama " and "Capital Hill." Other notable examples include "Marine core " the "boarder " and "smocking" gun  just to name a few. Factba.se analyzed Trump's tweets from inauguration day 2017 until October 31  2019 and identified 188 misspellings  though the total is quite conservative  given the site's methodology. Since Halloween  Trump has also spelled wonderful as "wonerful " people as "prople " and hijacked as "highjacked." It's not just English teachers who are embarrassed by this pattern of poor spelling. Some of his critics have argued that it testifies to Trump's lack of fitness for the presidency. To put Trump's typos into perspective  Frischling's team compared Trump's errors to Democratic candidates  his family members and past presidents. "Even with the benefit of the doubt -- erring always on the side of 'is this possibly correct' such as judgement and judgment -- eight of the top 10 [biggest misspellers] are either Trump family members  current or former White House officials  or the Trump corporation itself " Frischling said. Ivanka Trump  for example  has only posted 14 tweets with typos since her father took office. The official account for the First Lady  @FLOTUS  has posted just four. Elizabeth Warren has posted only five tweets with misspellings in the Trump era. Joe Biden has posted one. When compared with the previous president  Barack Obama  Trump's volume of errors becomes even more clear. Counting from when Trump started tweeting in May of 2009 and when Obama started tweeting in November 2012  Trump has made at least 350 spelling mistakes while Obama has only made four. Trump has an error rate of 1.40% while Obama has an error rate of just 0.06%. Methodology: As a raw method of sorting  the grammar and spelling from PerfectTense was first applied by Factba.se. Due to the prevalence of space-saving techniques in tweets  and the commonality of casual language  nearly all grammar rules were ignored and only three rules were kept as follows: spelling  homophone swap and incorrect multi-word phrase. Factba.se did not count retweets  replies or any tweet beginning with "@". Incorrect punctuation and grammar conjugation were not counted. Further  the spelling rules were given the benefit of the doubt. If any spelling was possibly correct  e.g. non-American spellings such as judgement and cancelled  they were not counted as an error. If any phrase could be slang or an accepted abbreviation given the context  it was not counted as an error. Accents and emphasis with extra letters e.g. soooooo were not counted. Any multi-word phrase that was a run-on  or repeated word  was subjected to the same benefit of the doubt. If words were in a language other than English (Spanish and in one particular account Hawaiian)  they were not checked for spelling and removed from the count. Similarly  misidentified people  e.g. "Melanie" when Melania was clearly referenced  were counted as a spelling error. Data is from account creation through October 31  2019 at 11:59:59 PM ET
The symbolic perfection of Trump as a Florida man,Nov 3  2019,Donald Trump and New York City used to be a perfect match. Both were brash  outspoken  greenback worshipping  tabloid icons obsessed with building taller  shinier skyscrapers. But the ardor has cooled  and Trump is switching his official abode from Manhattan's Trump Tower to his Mar-a-Lago resort in sunny Florida -- news that prompted by New York's Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo to tweet  "Good riddance." Sign up here for more analysis of US politics for global readers. There are various theories about the estrangement. The boy from Queens has become a conservative skunk in a liberal town  getting booed when he showed up at an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout at Madison Square Garden. But Trump and his kin could also save millions under Florida's lax tax laws. And unlike New York  the Republican-run state doesn't want to expose his tax returns. Nothing is forever with Trump. He may not be able to resist New York's allure once his presidency is over. But the move is symbolically appropriate: Trump has become more Florida Man than Manhattanite. One of the more remarkable aspects of Trumpism is how a millionaire's son with gold-plated seat belts on his private airliner made himself the voice of America's economically bereft. But Trump knows very well what it's like to be an outsider: He was mocked and rejected for decades by New York social elites when he tried to join their clubs with his nouveau riche ways. So while he'll hardly be slumming it in his ostentatious Palm Beach mansion  the President is closer in Florida to the spirit of the anti-establishment movement that he built in his name. And it doesn't hurt that the Sunshine state is a must-win if he's to capture a second term at the White House.
In one year  we'll know if Trump was a fluke or not,Nov 3  2019,By this time next year  we'll know whether President Donald Trump was a fluke or not. Today is one year out from the vote count that will be a pivot point in history  no matter how it goes. Will Americans validate the rule-breaking and fact-bending Trump presidency that scorns the post-World War II international system? Or will they return the world's most powerful nation -- at least for now -- to a more traditional path? History suggests that Trump's low approval ratings spell doom for a second term. He is also nearly certain to be impeached by the Democrat-majority House. But even if the House votes to impeach  the Republican-led Senate will likely keep him in office  and the strong economy is a good sign for any incumbent. Meanwhile  Trump is shrewdly turning his unchained behavior into a "No Mr. Nice Guy..." election pitch that loyalists will adore. Sign up here for more analysis of US politics for global readers The top-polling Democratic challengers have obvious liabilities: Long-time frontrunner Joe Biden is the only candidate with a real connection to African Americans -- a critical demographic -- but he's error-prone and leaves the party's radical grassroots cold. His rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders may be too progressive to appeal to Middle America. And rising outsider Pete Buttigieg lacks experience  and the fact that the South Bend  Indiana  mayor is openly gay may not be a fit in conservative pockets of America. Still  the dog-eat-dog nature of primary races means that few candidates come across with the gravitas of a potential president. It's the matchup with the other party's nominee that matters in the end. And Trump could turn out to be the weakest incumbent in generations. Or his divisive campaign tactics could deliver a victory on November 3  2020  that will make his 2016 upset look tame by comparison.
Lawyer says whistleblower willing to answer written questions from Republicans,Nov 3  2019,Mark Zaid  an attorney for the anonymous whistleblower whose allegations about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine ignited the House impeachment inquiry into the President  said Sunday he offered to have Republican lawmakers submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority. The whistleblower previously offered to answer lawmakers' questions under oath and in writing if they were submitted by the House Intelligence Committee as a whole. This new offer would be a direct channel of communication with the Republicans who are in the minority on that committee. Republican leadership has complained that the process is unfair and overly restrictive on their ability to question witnesses. In a series of tweets  Zaid said Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have sought to "expose our client's identity which could jeopardize their safety  as well as that of their family." "Despite long standing policy of HPSCI to protect #whistleblowers  especially anonymity (btw  this was consistent with my efforts w/GOP on #Benghazi)  GOP has sought to expose our client's identity which could jeopardize their safety  as well as that of their family " Zaid tweeted Sunday morning. The lawyer continued: "We have offered to @DevinNunes  Ranking HPSCI Member  opportunity for Minority to submit through legal team written questions to WBer. Qs cannot seek identifying info  regarding which we will not provide  or otherwise be inappropriate. We will ensure timely answers. We stand ready to cooperate and ensure facts - rather than partisanship - dictates any process involving the #whistleblower." Rep. Jim Jordan  the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee  said Sunday that written answers from the whistleblower are not sufficient  and said lawmakers need to hear from the whistleblower in person. "Written answers will not provide a sufficient opportunity to probe all the relevant facts and cross examine the so-called Whistleblower. You don't get to ignite an impeachment effort and never account for your actions and role in orchestrating it " Jordan said. "We have serious questions about this individual's political bias and partisan motivations and it seems Mark Zaid and Adam Schiff are attempting to hide these facts from public scrutiny. Last week's testimony raised even more concerns about the anonymous whistleblower and our need to hear from them  in person." Jordan is not on the Intelligence panel  but he has served as a spokesman for House Republicans during the closed-door depositions in the impeachment inquiry  which the Oversight Committee has participated in. Zaid said Rep. Devin Nunes  the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee  has acknowledged receipt of his offer to have GOP lawmakers submit written questions to his client  but said the California Republican has not yet provided a substantive response. A Nunes spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Zaid said the offer underscores his client's desire to ensure his complaint is handled in a nonpartisan way. "Being a whistleblower is not a partisan job nor is impeachment an objective. That is not our role " Zaid tweeted  adding that they "stand ready to cooperate and ensure facts - rather than partisanship - dictates any process involving" his client. Trump has repeatedly attacked the whistleblower and tried to discredit the individual  saying he deserves to "meet his accuser" and has demanded the whistleblower's identity be revealed. "The Whistleblower got it sooo wrong that HE must come forward " the President tweeted Sunday morning. Trump also accused the whistleblower of partisanship though he said he had no personal knowledge. In October  Republicans on committees leading the impeachment inquiry sent a letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff demanding he bring the whistleblower in to testify publicly. Democrats have said they will not do it over concerns about keeping the person's identity secret. "They have the right to remain anonymous " Schiff said on Tuesday after the deposition of White House top Ukraine expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. "They certainly should not be subject to these kind of vicious attacks and other words and actions that threaten their safety for doing their patriotic duty. And so we will make every effort to make sure that  notwithstanding the President or his allies' desire to come out and exact political revenge on this whistleblower  that our committee is never used for that purpose."

The 5 top 2020 stories you need to know this week,Nov 3  2019,With 92 days until the Iowa caucuses and a record number of Democratic candidates  the 2020 election is already in full swing. Every Sunday  outline the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they're ranked -- so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week. 5. Andrew Yang is still underrated: If I told you six months ago that former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke would drop out of the 2020 race before Andrew Yang -- and that that decision would make total and complete sense to any objective observer -- you would have laughed. And rightly so. But here we are. Yang  the technologist who has based his entire campaign on the dangers of automation and the idea of giving every American 18 years of age or older $1 000 a month for their entire lives  continues to gain strength -- in terms of polling and fundraising -- even as better-established candidates  like O'Rourke  are dropping from the race amid slackening support. He has nearly quadrupled his campaign staff over the past three months. He's opened 10 field offices in early states in just the last month. He's hired on Tad Devine and Julian Mulvey  the media consultants behind Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign  to help shape his image. And he continues to be the candidate having the most fun on the campaign trail. Over the weekend  Yang hosted "Yangapolooza!" in downtown Des Moines  joining Weezer's Rivers Cuomo on stage to sing "Say It Ain't So." The playfulness of Yang (and his campaign) may be why he still isn't being taken as seriously as his growth in the race suggests he should be. Yang is still seen as a sort of fun afterthought in the race. While he isn't a top-tier candidate in the race as of yet  his fundraising  staffing and trend line all suggest he is very much moving into the second tier even as many of his better-known rivals fade away entirely. Is Yang going to be the nominee? I don't think so. But I do think he is on a track to be in the race -- and a factor in it -- for months to come. Which is a huge win for him (and the rest of the Yang Gang). 4. Who has to win New Hampshire?: The filing deadline for 2020 candidates in New Hampshire is this Friday. So who's ahead -- and who needs to win the state to keep their presidential dreams alive? At the moment  Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren looks like the Granite State front-runner. She's ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden by 4 points and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by 5  according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls in the state. No one else gets double-digits  with South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg the closest with nearly 9% support. So who has to win the state? Some of that  of course  depends on what happens in Iowa. If you assume either Warren or Buttigieg wins Iowa -- much more on that below -- then New Hampshire turns into an absolute must-win for Sanders. Sanders won New Hampshire overwhelmingly over Hillary Clinton in 2016  and if he's not able to replicate that success four years later with a much more divided field  it could be curtains. Biden  also  will have considerable pressure on him to overperform expectations in New Hampshire if he doesn't win Iowa (and it doesn't look like he will at the moment). Biden has held the front-runner role for the entirety of the race -- even though there are clear signs (early state polls  fundraising) of weakening. If the titular front-runner can't win in either of the first two voting states  then can that person really be considered the front-runner anymore? 3. The Kamala collapse: For months  it's been clear that California Sen. Kamala Harris has lost her way in the 2020 race. Following a shining moment in the first Democratic debate in the early summer. She's looked lost -- caught between trying to appeal to the most liberal wing of the party and preserving some centrist qualities that she believed would keep her viable in a general election.  Late last week  the hard reality of Harris' disappointing campaign hit home -- as she closed several of her offices in New Hampshire and fired all of her field organizers in the state. Harris' decision to give up on New Hampshire -- make no mistake  that is what she is doing -- feels less like a going-all-in-on-Iowa than it does an attempt to put a small Band-Aid over a gaping wound. Harris' poll numbers in Iowa  New Hampshire and beyond are in the low single-digits. She has struggled to raise the sort of money the top competitors -- sans Joe Biden -- have done. And that was before last week where her campaign acknowledged the deep peril her candidacy is in. Considering all of that  the big question surrounding Harris is not whether she can make a comeback. It's when will she drop out and  relatedly  whether she will endorse any of her rivals. 2. Iowa has a new top two: The combination of a new New York Times poll in Iowa and this weekend's cattle call of 2020 candidates at the state party's big annual fundraiser have made one thing clear with 92 days left before the caucuses: The two candidates to beat are Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The Times poll  which was conducted in conjunction with Siena College  showed Warren at 22% with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 19%  Buttigieg at 18% and former Vice President Joe Biden at 17%.  While that suggest the field is closely clumped  both Warren and Buttigieg have been trending upward in the state for months while Sanders has  generally  held steady and Biden had faded. Then there was the the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Celebration on Friday night -- where Warren and Buttigieg shined  both in terms of their organizations and the candidates' performances.  "On Friday  Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend  Indiana  Mayor Pete Buttigieg showed why they've been steadily rising in the polls  bringing the most supporters and delivering the clearest arguments of the night " wrote CNN's Eric Bradner. There is  of course  time for the current trajectories of the candidates to change. But momentum matters in politics -- and especially in a state like Iowa that gets so much attention from candidates and coverage from the media. And at the moment  Iowa looks like a two-person race between Warren and Buttigieg. 1. 365 days and counting...: In exactly one year's time  voters will head to the polls to decide whether or not President Donald Trump deserves a second term. So how do things look for the incumbent right now? By most historical measures  not so good. Trump's job approval rating has never been over 50% in Gallup tracking polls  a first for a sitting president. Gallup's latest poll in mid-October showed Trump's job approval at just 39% compared to 57% who disapprove. (It's possible that the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has given Trump a bit of a bump since that poll.) And the number of people who strongly disapprove heavily outstrips those who strongly approve of Trump. In hypothetical general election matchups  Trump trails all the most likely Democratic nominees  according to the Real Clear Politics polling averages. Biden has a nearly 9-point edge  while Warren leads by 5  Sanders by 6 and Buttigieg by 3. That national polling is also generally consistent with swing state data -- particularly in upper Midwest states like Wisconsin and Michigan where Trump won in 2016. The silver lining amid all this potential doom and gloom for the President continues to be the economy. The October jobs report was stronger than expected with unemployment at 3.6% and 128 000 jobs created last month. Trump continues to get his best poll ratings when it comes to his handling of the economy. Given that  it's no surprise that the economy was front and center in his new national ad first unveiled during the World Series.  The one big unknown in all of this  of course  is who the Democratic nominee will be. Concern is mounting that Warren might be too liberal and too easily caricatured by Trump. But that remains to be seen. Still  it's worth remembering that Trump will face off against a specific Democrat with unique strengths and weaknesses -- not a generic Democratic ideal. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect Yang's monthly dividend plan.
White House aide refusing to testify was on the Trump-Ukraine call when Mulvaney wasn't,Nov 3  2019,The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry are hoping to hear from Robert Blair  an assistant to President Donald Trump and senior adviser to acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney  though that looks unlikely considering Blair's attorney said he has refused to testify in the probe. The House committees investigating Trump had scheduled Blair's deposition for Monday. Blair -- who was on the line during Trump's July call with Ukraine's President -- was requested to testify about White House policy toward Ukraine. "Mr. Blair is caught between the assertions of legal duty by two coequal branches of government  a conflict which he cannot resolve " Blair's attorney Whit Ellerman told CNN on Saturday. Blair has not yet received a subpoena  but Ellerman said Blair will still refuse to testify if he is subpoenaed. An assistant to the President Blair  who was associate director for national security programs in the Office of Management and Budget  followed Mulvaney in January to the White House when Mulvaney became acting chief of staff. Mulvaney made Blair an assistant to the President. Blair serves as Mulvaney's senior adviser for national security issues. Blair's hiring allowed Mulvaney to have a hand in national security issues without having to go through former White House national security adviser John Bolton. After Bolton was fired  one administration official said that Blair could be a favorite to replace Bolton because of his support from Mulvaney. Blair was one of just a small group of officials on the line during Trump's controversial phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mulvaney was not. During the July 25 call  Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden -- despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or his son  Hunter  in Ukraine. The phone call was part of a whistleblower's complaint that alleged Trump sought "to solicit interference" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election  and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied doing anything improper. Before the Trump administration Before joining the Trump administration  Blair worked for the past 14 years as a staffer for several committees in the House of Representatives. His last position was staff director on the House Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations. He previously worked as a regional adviser for Africa at the US State Department of State from 2001-2003. According to his LinkedIn profile  he received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and two master's degrees from Tufts University. He served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Africa during the mid-1990s.
Booing Trump is giving him what he deserves,Nov 3  2019,Another sporting event  another cascade of boos hurled at President Donald Trump. Though booing of politicians is not that unusual  it sure seems like Trump is making booing him at sporting events America's newest pastime. And the boos  perhaps on their own unremarkable  signify a growing swath of the American population may be unhappy with the President's job performance. The latest example took place Saturday night when Trump attend the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) at Madison Square Garden. Apparently  the "fighting" in the nation's capital wasn't enough for Trump so he needed to spend his weekend watching more. When Trump entered the famous sporting arena  according to CNN  he was "met with loud  sustained boos " along with some cheers. Of note  according to ESPN reporter Ariel Helwani  Trump was not shown on the big screen when he entered  begging the question -- was this potentially done by design to avoid more boos? Still  Saturday night's UFC response was far better than the reaction Trump received last Sunday night when he attended Game 5 of the World Series in Washington  DC. There  when Trump was shown on the stadium's large screen  the crowd began booing him loudly -- to the point it reached an estimated nearly 100 decibels. To put that in context  the CDC notes that sustained exposure to that level of sound for 15 minutes or more can cause hearing loss after routine or repeated exposure. The boisterous booing was then followed up by chants of "Lock him up." Not surprisingly  both events trended on Trump's favorite social media platform  Twitter. After the World Series game  #TrumpBooed dominated  while on Sunday morning  #TrumpBooedagain was a leading hashtag. But it was likely Saturday's boos at the UFC fight that stung Trump more. And here's why. The UFC fights are run by outspoken Trump supporter Dana White  who was an official speaker at the 2016 Republican National Convention. There he boldly declared  "I stand with Donald Trump." Add to that  the UFC audience comprises a group of people who more likely comprise Trump's base. As ESPN publication "Undefeated" explains  the fan base is predominately white and  as Bleacher reports  also largely male -- and Trump won 62% of white males in the 2016 election. Perhaps it's the concern that Trump was being rejected by an audience he should do well with  and at an event organized by a well-known Trump backer  that so concerned Trump  along with his sons Donald Jr. and Eric  that they took to Twitter to push back on the news stories that Trump was booed. First  there was Eric who straight up tried to gaslight people with his tweet Saturday night  "At #UFC244 - chanting "Donald Trump  Donald Trump... USA USA." The younger Trump only included a still image -- and not an audio clip in his tweet  which could have supported his assertion. And it may be for good reason. Thus far  it appears there's simply no reporting or viral clips to support his claim. In any event  Trump retweeted Eric's apparently fact-free claim. Gaslighting appears to be a Trump family tradition. Then there was Donald Jr. who was apparently so upset by the booing reports that he resorted to cursing on Twitter  writing  "Despite the bullshit from blue checkmark Twitter  when we walked into the arena it was overwhelmingly positive..." "Blue checkmark" are accounts where the identity of the user is verified by Twitter -- including his own -- but some on the right have claimed that these checkmarks are liberals  despite a lack of reporting to support this. In fact  Donald Jr. was so desperate to share proof that the crowd "overwhelmingly" cheered his father  the best he could do was include a link to an article from conservative tabloid The New York Post. But even the headline of that article was mixed at best  reading  "More cheers than boos greet President Trump at UFC 244 at MSG." And the body of the article was worse  noting that while Trump did get cheers  he also did receive "plenty of 'boos' and the occasional raised middle finger as well." Again  Trump retweeted this tweet in an effort to convince his followers he received an "overwhelmingly positive" response. And  on Sunday morning  Trump finally commented himself -- tweeting  "Walking into Madison Square Garden last night...for the big @UFC fight Championship fight was a little bit like walking into a Trump Rally. Plenty of MAGA...Great energy." Funny  I don't recall Trump rallies where Trump was loudly booed by large swaths of the audience. Trump getting booed at events that aren't Trump rallies is frankly not that surprising. After all  a Washington Post poll released Thursday found Trump's approval rating at 38%  while 58% of Americans disapprove of the job he's doing as President. Worse  when voters were asked if they strongly approve or disapprove of Trump  only 30% gave Trump a strong thumbs up  while 48% responded they strongly disapprove of his presidency. And those figures could even include a few white men  who have traditionally been considered Trump supporters and UFC fans. Personally  I think Trump has earned every boo he gets. From his racist remarks to his cruelty toward immigrants  he has failed the US and its citizens. And given polls showing nearly 60% of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing  he should brace himself to hear a lot more boos between now and when he finally vacates the White House.
2016 Presidential Election Investigation Fast Facts,Oct 12  2017,Here's a look at investigations into Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. For details about computer hacking during the campaign  visit 2016 Presidential Campaign Hacking Fast Facts. Special counsel Robert Mueller and multiple congressional committees launched Russia-related investigations in 2017. Select congressional and federal investigations: FBI - In July of 2016  the FBI launched a counterintelligence investigation into possible links between the Russian government and Trump campaign officials. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence - On January 13  2017  the committee announced that it was conducting a probe of Russian meddling. This investigation and others were sparked by a declassified report from the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) that described a multifaceted effort led by Russian President Vladimir Putin to interfere with the election by releasing damaging information about Clinton to help Trump. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence - On January 25  2017  the committee announced that it is investigating Russia's active measures during the presidential campaign as well as the underlying intelligence that led to the DNI's conclusions about Russia's intentions. The committee was led by Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) prior to 2019. (Nunes stepped away from the probe temporarily after the Ethics Committee announced it was looking into allegations he made unauthorized disclosures of classified information. When Nunes stepped away  Mike Conaway (R-TX) took his place. Even though Nunes said that he was formally stepping away from his role leading the investigation  he continued to review classified intelligence on Russia matters and he still had sway issuing subpoenas.) The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform - On March 22  2017  the committee requested information about former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn's paid speaking engagements overseas. After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey  the committee began looking into the circumstances surrounding the dismissal. The Senate Judiciary Committee - On May 17  2017  the committee called on the White House and the FBI to turn over all memos related the president's interactions with Comey. In addition to conducting an oversight investigation of Comey's dismissal  the committee has held hearings on the Foreign Agents Registration Act and attempts to influence the election. The committee also interviewed Donald Trump Jr. and other witnesses behind closed doors. Special Counsel - On May 17  2017  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead an investigation into Russian interference and related matters that could result in criminal prosecutions. On March 22  2019  the Justice Department announced the special counsel's office completed its probe  after 22 months  charges against 37 defendants  seven guilty pleas and one conviction at trial. A redacted version of Mueller's report was released on April 18  2019. READ: Tracking the Russia investigations Timeline: April 12  2015 - Clinton officially launches her presidential campaign. June 16  2015 - Trump launches his campaign. February 2016 - Flynn  a retired general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)  begins advising Trump on foreign policy matters  according to Reuters. Flynn became a prominent critic of the Obama administration after he was ousted from the DIA in 2014. March 29  2016 - Paul Manafort  a veteran GOP consultant  joins the Trump campaign as a strategist to help prepare for the Republican National Convention. April 27  2016 - Trump delivers his first major foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak is one of the diplomats in the audience. Trump's son-in-law and campaign adviser Jared Kushner later says he shook hands with Kislyak at the event. May 19  2016 - Manafort is promoted to chief strategist and campaign chairman. June 3  2016 - Trump Jr. receives an email from Rob Goldstone  a music publicist whose clients include Azerbaijani-Russian singer Emin Agalarov. Goldstone tells Trump Jr. that a Russian lawyer  working on behalf of the Kremlin  wants to pass along incriminating information about Clinton. He explains that Russia and its government want to support Trump by providing opposition research on Clinton. Trump Jr. indicates he is interested in seeing the information and suggests arranging a call. June 7-8  2016 - Goldstone sends Trump Jr. another email about setting up an in-person meeting with a "Russian government attorney" who will be flying from Moscow to New York on June 9  to talk to representatives from the Trump campaign at Trump Tower in New York. Trump loops in Manafort and Kushner. June 9  2016 - Manafort  Kushner and Trump Jr. meet with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. It is unclear what is discussed during the meeting  which was set up as a discussion of Russian-sourced opposition research on Clinton. Trump Jr. later says that Veselnitskaya did not present any valuable information during the meeting. The elder Trump did not participate  according to his legal team. June 12  2016 - During an interview on British television  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says that the website has obtained and will publish a batch of Clinton emails. June 14  2016 - The Washington Post reports hackers working for the Russian government accessed the DNC's computer system  stealing oppositional research on Trump and viewing staffers' emails and chat exchanges. The Kremlin  however  denies that the government was linked to the hack  and a US official tells CNN that investigators have not yet concluded that the cyberattack was directed by the Russian government. June 15  2016 - A cybersecurity firm hired by the DNC posts a public notice on its website describing an attack on the political committee's computer network by two groups associated with Russian intelligence. According to the post  two Russian-backed groups called "Cozy Bear" and "Fancy Bear" tunneled into the committee's computer system. In response  a blogger called Guccifer 2.0 claims that he alone conducted the hack  not the Russians. Furthermore  Guccifer 2.0 claims to have passed along thousands of files to WikiLeaks. Trump offers his own theory on the origins of the attack: suggesting in a statement that the DNC hacked itself to distract from Clinton's email scandal. June 20  2016 - Trump fires campaign manager Corey Lewandowski  who had worked with the team for more than a year. As campaign chairman  Manafort is now the top official overseeing Trump's White House run. July 22  2016 - Days before the Democratic National Convention  WikiLeaks publishes nearly 20 000 emails hacked from the DNC server. The documents include notes in which DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz insults staffers from the Bernie Sanders campaign and messages that suggest the organization was favoring Clinton rather than remaining neutral. Wasserman Schultz resigns in the aftermath of the leak. July 25  2016 - The FBI announces it has launched an investigation into the DNC hack. Although the statement doesn't indicate that the agency has a particular suspect or suspects in mind  US officials tell CNN they think the cyberattack is linked to Russia. July 27  2016 - During a press conference  Trump talks about Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and calls on hackers to find deleted emails. "Russia  if you're listening  I hope you're able to find the 30 000 emails that are missing " says Trump. On or about that same day  hackers target email accounts used by individuals in Clinton's personal office for the first time  according to an indictment filed in 2018 by the special counsel's office. August 14  2016 - The New York Times publishes a report that $12.7 million in illegal cash payments to Manafort were listed in a secret ledger linked to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych  who resigned amid street protests. Manafort had worked as an adviser to Yanukovych and his associates dating back at least a decade. August 19  2016 - Manafort resigns as Trump's campaign chairman. October-November 2016 - Over the course of a month  WikiLeaks publishes more than 58 000 messages hacked from the account of John Podesta  Clinton's campaign chairman. October 6  2016 - DCLeaks  a self-described collective of "hacktivists" seeking to expose the influence of special interests on elected officials  publishes a batch of documents stolen from Clinton ally Capricia Marshall. DCLeaks is later identified as a front for Russian military intelligence. October 7  2016 - The Department of Homeland Security and the Office of National Intelligence on Election Security issue a statement declaring that the intelligence community is "confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions." According to the statement  document releases on websites WikiLeaks and DC Leaks mirror the methods and motivations of past Russian-directed cyberattacks. December 1  2016 - Kushner and Flynn meet with Kislyak at Trump Tower. Kushner later describes the encounter as a quick introduction  pushing back on a Washington Post report that the three talked about establishing backchannel communication with the Russians.

The latest on the Trump impeachment inquiry,Nov 2  2019,President Trump dismissed polls that show growing support for impeachment among Americans as “fake ” and “lousy.”  “Well  you’re reading the wrong polls. You’re reading the wrong polls ” the President Told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond on the south lawn of the White House today.  “I have the real polls. I have the real polls ” Trump claimed. “The CNN polls are fake. The FOX polls have always been lousy  I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster  but the real polls  and you look at the polls that came out this morning  people don’t want anything to do with impeachment. It’s a phony scam. It’s a hoax. And the whistleblower should be revealed because the whistleblower gave false information.” The President did not give any more details on what he says are the “real polls.” Recent polls: The Fox News poll released this morning found 49% in favor of impeaching and removing the president  45% were opposed. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll also released this morning found 49% in favor of impeaching and removing the president  46% were opposed. Two polls released last week show Americans divided on the impeachment inquiry. A poll from the University of Texas and the Texas Tribune found that Texas voters were about evenly split over whether Trump should be removed from office before the end of his term. The Washington Post/ABC News poll shows Americans are split along party lines on whether to impeach and remove Trump. President Trump attacked the whistleblower who set off the impeachment inquiry as an  “Obama person ” a “never Trumper ” and “a radical." “The whistleblower gave a very inaccurate report ” Trump told reporters on the south lawn of the White House  after returning from New York City. Trump made it clear he was relying only on media reports when it came to the identity of the whistleblower. Earlier today: Mark Zaid  an attorney for the whistleblower at the center of the ongoing impeachment inquiry says he offered to have Republicans on the House Intelligence Community submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority  CBS News is reporting. According to CBS  Zaid said he contacted Representative Devin Nunes  the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee  on Saturday to say his client is willing to answer Republicans' questions under oath and penalty of perjury if lawmakers submitted written questions to the whistleblower's legal team. The identity of the whistleblower: Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match behind closed doors Tuesday while interviewing a witness in the impeachment investigation  with Democrats accusing Republicans of trying to out the anonymous whistleblower  according to five sources from both parties. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff objected to a line of questioning from Republicans during the deposition of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman  the National Security Council official in charge of Ukraine policy  charging that the GOP questions were part of an effort to out the whistleblower  sources said. Republicans pushed back  arguing they were simply asking questions about who Vindman might have spoken with — and that it was not an effort to out the whistleblower. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney didn't exactly get a ringing endorsement from President Donald Trump today  who was asked if he still has confidence in Mulvaney.  "Well  he's workin' " Trump replied. "As long as he's with me  I have confidence."  Mulvaney drew criticism from Republicans and Trump's ire after his briefing room performance last month where he admitted to a quid pro quo over Ukraine.  But more recently  White House sources have said there's no indication that Mulvaney is going to be fired.   President Trump said it is up to his former National Security Adviser John Bolton and "the lawyers" if he is going to testify in the House impeachment inquiry.  Bolton has been in talks with the House committees investigating Trump about giving his testimony about US policy toward Ukraine. Other witnesses have already testified that Bolton had concerns about US security aid to Ukraine being withheld amid pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrats.  Ahead of Bolton's potential testimony  the President -- who fired Bolton in an early September tweet -- proclaimed to "like John Bolton" and to have "always got along with him."  "I like John Bolton. I always got along with him  but that’s going to be up to him " Trump said of Bolton potentially testifying. Bolton and Trump did not always get along and their relationship soured in the final months of Bolton's tenure  leading to his dismissal. White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said this morning that she does not know if President Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine  but stood by the White House's response that there was no quid pro quo between the President and the country. Her comments come after the House passed an impeachment resolution outlining procedures moving forward in its impeachment inquiry into the President centered on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A whistleblower complaint alleges the President pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son  Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden in Ukraine. Trump has denied any wrongdoing Conway told CNN's Dana Bash on "State of the Union" Sunday there was "no quid pro quo in this call in terms of the President" when asked about the foreign aid. "President Trump never said to the Ukrainian President 'do this and you'll get your aid.' It is simply not here " she said. But when pressed on what happened after the July call between Trump and Zelensky  and if she felt confident there was no quid pro quo  Conway said she did not know. Mark Zaid  an attorney for the whistleblower at the center of the ongoing impeachment inquiry says he offered to have Republicans on the House Intelligence Community submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority  CBS News is reporting. According to CBS  Zaid said he contacted Representative Devin Nunes  the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee  on Saturday to say his client is willing to answer Republicans' questions under oath and penalty of perjury if lawmakers submitted written questions to the whistleblower's legal team. Previously  the whistleblower had offered to answer questions under oath and in writing if submitted by the House Intelligence Committee as a whole. This new offer would be a direct channel of communication with the Republicans who are in the minority on that committee. Republican leadership has complained that the process is unfair and overly restrictive on their ability to question witnesses  CBS said.  Zaid said the offer underscores his client's desire to ensure his complaint is handled in a nonpartisan way  CBS said. On CNN’s "State of the Union" this morning  Kellyanne Conway  counselor to the President  would not say whether it was appropriate for President Trump to ask a foreign power to look into his political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Conway tried to invoke suspicions about the Bidens and said the former vice president should face scrutiny as he runs for president. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. She also said Joe Biden is not a top political rival of Trump  bringing up an instance of Biden misspeaking on the campaign trail in Iowa. When pressed further on the issue by host Dana Bash  Conway contended that asking a foreign leader to investigate a political rival is “not impeachable” and repeatedly denied that there was a quid pro quo related to Ukrainian military aid. When asked about the US holding up military aid from Ukraine  Conway continually answered that Ukrainians now have aid from the US. However  when asked if there was a time when aid was held up because Trump wanted Ukraine to look into the Bidens  Conway answered “I don’t know  but I know they’ve got their aid.” Later in the exchange  Bash asked Conway point blank about a quid pro quo related to the military aid  to which Conway answered she didn’t know “whether aid was being held up or for how long.” Conway denied that Trump’s assertion that “Never Trumpers” were “human scum” applied to Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman  although the President has called Vindman a “Never Trumper.” Conway said she would “never disparage the patriotism or the public service” of Vindman  but then called his interpretation of the July 25 phone call into question. Bash also asked Conway about newly released memos from the Mueller investigation obtained by CNN detailing former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort’s efforts to push a conspiracy blaming Ukraine for 2016 election hacking  despite the US intelligence community’s assessment that Russians were to blame. Conway said she trusts US intelligence officials  but when asked by Bash if this means she thinks the Russians were responsible  Conway answered “who cares.” As for the President’s beliefs on the matter  Conway repeated Trump’s rhetoric calling into question whether Russia  Ukraine  or a “guy in New Jersey” were responsible for “interference overall.” She later said the President “has great faith in the U.S. intelligence community” and did not go any further on whether Trump believes Russia was responsible for 2016 election interference. Watch the moment: The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry are hoping to hear from Robert Blair  an assistant to President Trump and senior adviser to acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney  though that looks unlikely considering Blair's attorney said he has refused to testify in the probe. The House committees investigating Trump had scheduled Blair's deposition for Monday. Blair -- who was on the line during Trump's July call with Ukraine's President -- was requested to testify about White House policy toward Ukraine. "Mr. Blair is caught between the assertions of legal duty by two coequal branches of government  a conflict which he cannot resolve " Blair's attorney Whit Ellerman told CNN on Saturday. Blair has not yet received a subpoena  but Ellerman said Blair will still refuse to testify if he is subpoenaed. Blair  who was associate director for national security programs in the Office of Management and Budget  followed Mulvaney in January to the White House when Mulvaney became acting chief of staff. Mulvaney made Blair an assistant to the President. Blair serves as Mulvaney's senior adviser for national security issues. Blair's hiring allowed Mulvaney to have a hand in national security issues without having to go through former White House national security adviser John Bolton. After Bolton was fired  one administration official said that Blair could be a favorite to replace Bolton because of his support from Mulvaney. Blair was one of just a small group of officials on the line during Trump's controversial phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mulvaney was not. During the July 25 call  Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden -- despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or his son  Hunter  in Ukraine. The phone call was part of a whistleblower's complaint that alleged Trump sought "to solicit interference" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election  and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied doing anything improper. President Trump took to Twitter this morning to criticize the whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry and demand that the person "come forward." Trump claims the "Fake News Media knows" who the whistleblower is and doesn't want to reveal the person's identity because "there would be hell to pay." The tweet comes after Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match behind closed doors Tuesday while interviewing a witness in the impeachment investigation  with Democrats accusing Republicans of trying to out the anonymous whistleblower  according to five sources from both parties. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff objected to a line of questioning from Republicans during the deposition of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman  the National Security Council official in charge of Ukraine policy  charging that the GOP questions were part of an effort to out the whistleblower  sources said. Republicans pushed back  arguing they were simply asking questions about who Vindman might have spoken with — and that it was not an effort to out the whistleblower. Fight over whistleblower rights: Once the deposition began  tensions quickly ratcheted up over the identity of the whistleblower. One Democratic lawmaker said that Schiff told lawmakers the whistleblower had the statutory right to anonymity  which is what prompted GOP Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina to interject. Schiff told him that when he was finished  he could speak  the source said. Meadows responded that he read the statute  and the whistleblower had no right to anonymity. Meadows argued that the whistleblower had a right to protection from retribution  but not a right to anonymity  according to the source  which prompted Schiff to respond that the committee would not allow that line of questioning. Read Trump's tweet below: CNN's Manu Raju  Jeremy Herb  Lauren Fox and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report. Here are the latest developments in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump: Subpoenas issued: The House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas to John Eisenberg  the top lawyer on the White House’s National Security Council  and Brian McCormack  the former chief of staff to Energy Secretary Rick Perry  according to a source familiar with the matter. Rick Perry: Energy Secretary Rick Perry will not participate in a closed-door deposition with impeachment investigators but would consider testifying in an open hearing  according to the Department of Energy. New polls: Two new polls show Americans are divided on the impeachment inquiry. A poll from the University of Texas and the Texas Tribune found that Texas voters were about evenly split over whether Trump should be removed from office before the end of his term. The Washington Post/ABC News poll shows Americans are split along party lines on whether to impeach and remove Trump. White House goes on defense: White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the ongoing impeachment inquiry "a sham and a kangaroo court" in an interview with Fox News this morning. She said Democrats were "unhinged" and described the ongoing probe "unjust and unfair." House on recess: Rep. Adam Schiff  the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  told CNN the House recess  which will go through Nov. 11  will not impede their investigation. Schiff said some of the transcripts of the closed-door interviews could be made public as early as next week.  More details emerge: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman  the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert  testified this week that he was told not to talk with anyone about the July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president  according to a source familiar with the testimony. Tim Morrison  the President's top Russia adviser who also testified this week  told lawmakers he tried to find out whether Trump told a key US diplomat he wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens  multiple sources familiar with his closed-door impeachment inquiry deposition on Capitol Hill told CNN.
Impeachment proceedings could be a gift to US enemies,Nov 3  2019,The House of Representatives voted to formalize impeachment proceedings on Thursday  and they have a heavy slate of witnesses scheduled for testimony this week. Meanwhile  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has indicated he will release transcripts of recent closed-door witness depositions  which means the country -- and the rest of the world -- will get a look at the inner workings of our government. This comes after President Donald Trump and his supporters have pilloried House Democrats for not doing more of their investigatory work in public. But they may want to be careful about what they wish for. While this newfound transparency is an important part of the impeachment process  it won't be cost-free. In fact  it comes with additional security risks  as our enemies will likely follow these developments -- hoping to glean insights into potential White House weaknesses. Going public Our enemies have already learned a lot from the whistleblower complaint  written statements and leaks that have emerged from the closed-door depositions. Intimate details have been revealed about how the US government works -- including who works on call readouts  who listens to classified presidential phone calls  how classified servers are used to store and transmit material and how dysfunctional US bureaucracy has become under this President. Throw in public hearings and the release of deposition transcripts -- and there are significant additional risks. Think about it this way -- it's not like we have Kremlin officials testifying about how Russian President Vladimir Putin's communications work  or which advisers and personal staff he directs to implement his dirty work. New information that will be revealed to the public over the course of the impeachment proceedings will be prime fodder for manipulation by foreign powers. The US intelligence community assessed that Russia is intent on using information warfare to undermine the credibility of our institutions -- the presidency likely being one of them. Detailed accounts that may reveal how the President  or perhaps his staff  misused their roles will just add fuel to the fire that Russia  and likely other adversaries  are intent on stoking through information warfare and their cadre of bots  trolls and fake personas. Trump continues to deny any wrongdoing. Lawyering up While transcripts from past depositions could go public as early as this week and public hearings could begin next week  this week's depositions will continue behind closed doors. And the deposition schedule is jam packed with White House officials and Office of Management Budget staffers who may have firsthand experiences to share about the President's intentions and motivations regarding Ukraine. State Departments officials (both career official Undersecretary David Hale  and a political appointee  Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl) are also on the schedule. But it's unclear who will actually show up. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry has already said he'll buck his call to testify  and former Deputy National Security Advisor Charles Kupperman has responded to a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee by filing a lawsuit against both the House and the President -- leaving it up to the court to decide how he should proceed. His former boss  John Bolton  is slated to testify on Thursday  and while his deposition could broaden the scope of the inquiry significantly  his lawyer said he will not testify voluntarily. It's unclear whether he'll show up even if he is subpoenaed. Some of the most valuable testimony could end up coming from National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg  who is scheduled to testify on Monday. Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman  who testified last week  said that he listened in on the infamous July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call  and shared his concerns with Eisenberg  who told him not to discuss the call  a source familiar with the testimony told CNN. Then  Eisenberg and other NSC lawyers allegedly decided the July 25 call readout would be moved to a codeword server. NSC lawyers report to the white house counsel and typically also take direction from the national security adviser. While John Bolton  the national security adviser at the time of the call  is no longer at the White House  White House Counsel Paul Cipollone still is. And Cipollone has been the team captain for Trump's anti-impeachment inquiry efforts  penning a letter to House leadership in which he said the President wouldn't comply with the inquiry. While NSC lawyers may try to indicate that they didn't see anything wrong with what he said on the call or in advising US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland to tell the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens  they'll likely be pressed on who was aware of their efforts in the White House Counsel's office and whether the White House Counsel shared any concerns or updates directly with the President. Publicly procrastinating While it is important to uncover whether Trump abused his office and withheld aid to Ukraine in exchange for foreign election assistance  the impeachment proceedings are a massive resource drain on government officials who have to focus on responding to the inquiry rather than just doing their day jobs. This creates an opportunity for our adversaries to strike while the impeachment iron is hot and to try to push their own agendas. And the perception that the national security team is distracted has been buttressed lately. Former NSC Senior Adviser Tim Morrison's testimony indicated that he spent time fact checking Sondland's claims about the President's wishes rather than doing his actual day job  and he's since resigned. Vindman said that he's been shut out of important work on Ukraine and other countries in his portfolio since the impeachment inquiry began. And many other officials working on Ukraine have had to testify or are having to spend time with counsel coming up with ways to avoid appearing or providing documents. When it comes to a country like Ukraine  this could have seriously adverse implications. Russia and Ukraine are still engaged in armed conflict  not to mention contentious energy negotiations. Our special representative for Ukraine negotiations  Ambassador Kurt Volker  resigned at the outset of impeachment proceedings. And  as for the Ukrainians  they probably assume that any work they do with US officials could end up part of a public deposition or hearing going forward. In short  while the US national security team has to deal with the consequences of Trump's actions  other countries can continue their own business as usual. Our distraction is our enemies' opportunity.
It's one year until the 2020 election. Here are 10 numbers you need to know,Nov 3  2019,In exactly one year  Americans will head to the ballot boxes to vote in presidential  Senate and gubernatorial elections. Here are 10 numbers you'll want to know. 1. 8 Democratic primary debates left The fifth Democratic presidential primary debate will be held on November 20 in Georgia and co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. PBS NewsHour and Politico will co-host the sixth Democratic debate on December 19 in Los Angeles. The Democratic National Committee announced it would host 12 primary debates in total  which leaves six more debates in 2020. 2. 4 general election debates in 2020 Three presidential general election debates and one vice presidential debate are set to take place in September and October of 2020. 3. 3 months until the Iowa caucuses The famed first-in-the-nation contest takes place on February 3  2020. In total  there will be 12 Democratic caucus contests: Iowa  Nevada  American Samoa  Democrats abroad  North Dakota  Northern Mariana Island  Alaska  Hawaii  Wyoming  Kansas  Guam and Virgin Islands. On the Republican side  six of those states and territories (Iowa  Hawaii  American Samoa  Northern Marianas  North Dakota  and Virgin Islands) will hold caucuses as well. Some GOP contests will take place in the form of state conventions or state committee votes to allocate their delegates to the RNC. In most caucuses  voters are required to show up at a designated place  group themselves by which candidate they support and then lobby others to join them. In a primary  by contrast  people go to their designated voting place and cast a ballot. State Democratic parties holding traditional caucuses are required to give an alternate voting method for those who are unable to vote during the traditional caucus gathering. 4. 100 days until New Hampshire The next contest -- and first primary -- of 2020 takes place in New Hampshire on February 11  2020. In total  42 States and territories holding presidential primaries for Democrats and Republicans: Alabama  California  Colorado  Connecticut  Delaware  Florida  Georgia  Idaho  Illinois  Indiana  Kentucky  Louisiana  Maine  Maryland  Massachusetts  Michigan  Minnesota  Mississippi  Missouri  Montana  Nebraska  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New Mexico  New York  North Carolina  Ohio  Oklahoma  Oregon  Pennsylvania  Rhode Island  South Dakota  Tennessee  Texas  Utah  Vermont  Washington  West Virginia  Wisconsin  District of Columbia  Puerto Rico. Democratic primaries will also take place in South Carolina  Arizona  and Virginia. 5. 6 states no longer holding Republican primaries or caucuses Six state Republican parties canceled its 2020 primary or caucuses: Alaska  Arizona  Kansas  Nevada  South Carolina and Virginia.

Under new Democratic Party rules  superdelegates won't be able to vote on the first ballot for president unless their votes cannot mathematically change the outcome of the pledged delegate votes as determined by state primary and caucus results. For a Democratic candidate to win the nomination on the first ballot  they will need a majority of the pledged delegates without using superdelegates. 7. About 2 551 delegates to attend Republican National Convention About 2 551 delegates — including at least 168 unpledged delegates — are expected to attend the Republican National Convention in Charlotte  North Carolina  in August.

One Democrat  Tom Udall of New Mexico  has also announced his plans to retire. Additionally  there will be two special Senate elections: One for the seat occupied by Republican Johnny Isakson  who announced he is retiring at the end of this year for health reasons  and one for the seat formerly occupied by the late Republican John McCain  who died in 2018. (Sen. Martha McSally was appointed to McCain's seat and is running in the special election.) 10. 11 governor races Eleven gubernatorial races are set to take place in 2020: Delaware  Indiana  Missouri  Montana  New Hampshire  North Carolina  North Dakota  Utah  Vermont  Washington and West Virginia.
Republican presidential candidate Joe Walsh says Fox News and conservative radio are lying to Americans,Nov 3  2019,Former Republican Congressman and 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Walsh is slamming Fox News and conservative talk radio for their coverage of the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump. "This is an absolute shame and I think you've got to call it out for what it is " Walsh told CNN's Brian Stelter on "Reliable Sources" Sunday. "The Americans who listen to Fox News and conservative talk radio are being lied to and manipulated every day when it comes to impeachment." Walsh has staked his bid for the presidency on frequently and publicly criticizing Trump  and he's called on other Republicans to speak out and do the same. Now  he's calling out Fox News and conservative talk radio — a world he used to belong to as host of the Joe Walsh Show. His comments come just days after the House of Representatives voted along party lines and passed a resolution formalizing the impeachment inquiry into Trump following weeks of testimony on his interactions with Ukraine's president. Fox News declined to comment for this story. On Sunday  Walsh said he believes Trump "deserves to be impeached." But he said he's worried that not all Americans are getting the same information about the president's alleged actions. "The vast majority of the American people understand that when it comes to Ukraine  [Trump] did something wrong ' Walsh said. "But those people who listen to the opinion shows on Fox and those people who listen to my former world  conservative talk radio  have no clue because they're being told every day: 'He's done nothing wrong' ... It's dangerous." A new poll from the Wall Street Journal and NBC published Sunday found that 53% of Americans approve of the House impeachment inquiry  while 44% disapprove. As for the outcome of the probe  49% of respondents said Trump should be impeached and removed from office; 46% opposed impeachment and removal. The results represent a shift in support for impeachment — a similar poll in October saw more people oppose impeachment than approve of it. Walsh said that when he worked as a conservative radio host  he "got pressure every day" from his syndicator to speak highly of Trump. Walsh's show with conservative distributor Salem Media Network was ended when he announced his candidacy for president. He also claimed that his criticisms of Trump  even before his campaign began  have cost him airtime on Fox and other conservative outlets. "I'm a conservative " Walsh said. "They said: 'We don't want any conservative on Fox News who criticizes the president.'" Walsh has made multiple recent appearances on Fox  including a segment in late August with Fox Business host Stuart Varney in which Varney said he doesn't believe Trump has ever lied to the American people. In August he was on Dave Anthony's podcast Fox News Rundown.
Walsh: Americans listening to Fox News are lied to daily,Nov 3  2019,During an interview with CNN's Brian Stelter  2020 Republican presidential hopeful Joe Walsh slammed Fox News and conservative talk radio for their coverage of the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump.
Why the President's Twitter typos matter,Nov 3  2019,Spelling mistakes on social media are not uncommon  but President Donald Trump makes a lot more Twitter typos than most others in the political spotlight. CNN's Brian Stelter takes a closer look.
Polls: Biden  Warren and Sanders lead Democrats,Nov 3  2019,Three new national polls find that former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are leading the pack of Democratic presidential candidates less than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses  the first real test of the 2020 Democratic primary. Biden is at 28% among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic  while Warren  a Massachusetts Democrat  is at 23% and Sanders  a Vermont independent  is at 17%  according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday. In the September iteration of the poll  the former vice president had nearly the same amount of support while Warren was at 18% and Sanders was at 19%. South Bend  Indiana  Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 9% in the new poll  up from the 4% he had last month. No other candidate received above 2% in the poll. A Fox News poll released Sunday also shows the same three candidates leading the pack among Democratic voters  with Biden at 31%  Warren at 21% and Sanders at 19%. Buttigieg is at 7% in the Fox News poll  while both California Sen. Kamala Harris and businessman Andrew Yang were at 3%. No other candidate got above 2% in that poll. Meanwhile  an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll -- also released Sunday -- suggests a tighter contest with Warren's 23% within striking distance of Biden's 27%  and Sanders at 19% among Democratic voters. The poll also showed Buttigieg at 6%  Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 5% and Harris at 4%. Four-percent of voters in the poll picked Yang as their preferred candidate  while none of his opponents received above 2%. The polls come two days after the field lost a candidate -- former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke  who struggled to gain a decent amount of support in recent national polls. Who can beat Trump? Democratic voters think Biden has the best chance to beat President Donald Trump  according to the Washington Post-ABC News poll  but they didn't place the former vice president before his competitors when it came to five other categories  including mental sharpness and policy issues. Warren  on the other hand  led the pack when it came to mental sharpness  with 24% of Democrats saying she has the sharpest mental ability. Additionally  among the three oldest Democratic candidates -- Biden  Sanders and Warren -- voters were about evenly divided in that poll on whether Sanders was physically fit enough for the presidency. The concerns over Sanders' health comes after he suffered a heart attack in early October that forced him to take a break from the campaign trail. In the wake of the heart attack  Sanders said he won't be able to keep up the robust schedule he and his supporters have become accustomed to during campaigns. Eighty percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe Warren is healthy enough to serve as president  and 74% agree that Biden is healthy enough for the Oval Office. The Washington Post-ABC News poll was conducted by phone from October 27-30 in English and Spanish among a random national sample of 1 003 US adults reached by landlines and cellphones. The results have a margin of sampling error of of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points among the sample of 452 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent adults and is plus or minus six points among the sample of 402 Democratic-leaning registered voters. The Fox News poll was conducted by phone from October 27-30 from a random sample of 1 040 registered voters. The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points among the sample of 471 Democratic primary voters. The NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll was conducted by phone from October 27-30 from a random sample of 900 adults. The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points among the sample of 414 Democratic primary voters.
Kellyanne Conway says 'I don't know' if Trump held up Ukraine military aid,Nov 3  2019,White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that she does not know if President Donald Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine  but stood by the White House's response that there was no quid pro quo between Trump and the country's president. Her comments come after the House passed an impeachment resolution outlining procedures moving forward in its impeachment inquiry into the President centered on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A whistleblower complaint alleges the President pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son  Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden in Ukraine. Trump has denied any wrongdoing Conway told CNN's Dana Bash on "State of the Union" Sunday there was "no quid pro quo in this call in terms of the President" when asked about the foreign aid. "President Trump never said to the Ukrainian President 'do this and you'll get your aid.' It is simply not here " she said. But when pressed on what happened after the July call between Trump and Zelensky  and if she felt confident there was no quid pro quo  Conway said she did not know. "So you feel totally confident that at the core of this  at the heart of this  there was no quid pro quo?" Bash asked. "I feel confident about the fact that Ukraine has that aid and using it right now. That is because of this President that they have it. The last President ... " Conway said. "Kellyanne  you very notably won't say  'yes or no ' Bash interjected. "It doesn't ..." Conway said "Quid pro quo  yes or no?" Bash asked. "I just said to you. I don't know whether aid was being held up and for how long " Conway said. "I know there were two Senators  a Democrat and Republican who called over to Ukraine and inquired about the aid." Andrew Bates  spokesman for Biden  said on Sunday the Trump administration is "melting down." "In an extraordinary development  even the Trump adviser who coined the term 'alternative facts' is unwilling to say that Donald Trump didn't subvert American national security with a quid pro quo that would force a foreign country to lie about the candidate who's beaten him in over 70 polls " he said in a statement to CNN. "The White House has already admitted that Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to spread this vile  universally-debunked conspiracy theory. And the lead White House Ukraine expert  a decorated Iraq veteran  has now testified that military assistance was delayed in an attempt to force Ukraine to become an involuntary arm of the struggling Trump re-election campaign. Donald Trump's administration is melting down because of the lengths to which he'd go not to face Joe Biden next year."
Judge grants temporary restraining order against policy set to deny visas for immigrants who couldn't afford health insurance,Nov 2  2019,A judge in Oregon granted a temporary restraining order Saturday against a policy that would have denied immigrants a visa unless they can prove they will have health insurance. This order comes after a group of US citizens sued the Trump administration  arguing that this is a new form of "family separation." The lawsuit  filed in US District Court in Portland  Oregon  claims that the proclamation will bar hundreds of thousands of immigrants from coming to the United States  and as a result  could separate families who are immigrating via family-sponsored visas. Justice Action Center spokesperson Esther Sung said she was encouraged by the court's decision in a statement. "The ban would separate families and cut two-thirds of green-card-based immigration starting tonight  were the ban not stopped. It's egregious that President Trump is attempting to flout the will of Congress and squeeze through a complete overhaul of the nation's immigration laws without anyone noticing." "Today's decision highlights the urgency of blocking this health care ban before it causes irreparable damage to our community and those we serve " Carmen Rubio  the executive director of Latino Network  said in a statement. The proclamation is among a string of sweeping changes that could dramatically curb legal immigration to the United States. President Donald Trump issued the proclamation in October  saying  "immigrants who enter this country should not further saddle our healthcare system  and subsequently American taxpayers  with higher costs." The White House called the decision "wrong and unfair" in a statement on Sunday  saying the administration wasn't allowed to defend the policy in court. "We strongly disagree with the district court's decision to impose a nationwide injunction against the President's policy on a preliminary  emergency basis over the weekend without even affording the government an opportunity to provide a written defense " the statement read. "Once again  a nationwide injunction is permitting a single judge to thwart the President's policy judgment on a matter where Congress expressly gave the President authority." According to the Kaiser Family Foundation  in 2017  three-quarters of the 27.4 million uninsured people under age 65 were US citizens. Visa applicants would have to prove they would be covered by an approved health insurance within 30 days of entry into the US or possess the financial means to "pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs." The new requirement could make it more difficult for people to immigrate to the US  particularly if they do not have the financial means. Accepted health insurance includes employer-sponsored and family coverage plans  unsubsidized individual health plans  and short-term plans. Medicaid or Affordable Care Act subsidies do not qualify as "approved health insurance" under the proclamation.
